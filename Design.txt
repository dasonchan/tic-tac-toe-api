Design Reflections:

-This project was started as an one-person tic-tac-toe game,
but I decided to change it to a two-people game because it would
be more practical.
-Added winningPercentage as an attribute to the Player model. It 
was a format percentage string attribute. But I decided to change 
it into a float, which could serve different purposes, such as 
sorting, better.
-Added tie as a boolean so that the result field can contain 
three values: 'playerOne', 'playerTwo' and 'tie'.
-I decided to give players 3 points for a win, 1 point for a tie 
and 0 points for a loss. The rule is based on soccer's rule.
-Added gameOver to show the state of the game
-Added nextMove to sort the order 
-Using endpoints exceptions to handle error messages can be very 
helpful for the users and developers
