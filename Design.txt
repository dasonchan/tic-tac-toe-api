Design Reflections:

-This project was started as an one-person tic-tac-toe game,
but I decided to change it to a two-people game because it would
be more practical.
-Added winningPercentage as an attribute to the Player model. It 
was a format percentage string attribute. But I decided to change 
it into a float, which could serve different purposes, such as 
sorting, better.
-Added tie as a boolean so that the result field can contain 
three values: 'playerOne', 'playerTwo' and 'tie'.
-I decided to give players 3 points for a win, 1 point for a tie 
and 0 points for a loss. The rule is based on soccer's rule.
-Added gameOver to show the state of the game
-Added nextMove to sort the order 
-Using endpoints exceptions to handle error messages can be very 
helpful for the users and developers 
-One challenge for me was designing the models and forms. I had 
multiple ideas but I was not sure which one would work better. I 
decided to go ahead and start it without having a clear path and 
it was getting pretty messy. At the end I had to stop the project 
and redesign it. The development had become much easier after 
having a plan. 
-Another big challenge to me was testing. Due to the wrong 
configuration, I was not able to deploy this project when I first 
started it. I did not receive any error message on the console. 
I tried to test it locally but for some reason Chrome would not 
run it. Later I found out from a Udacity coach that I would need 
to run script manually because of the update on Chrome.
