Design Reflections:

-This project was started as an one-person tic-tac-toe game,
but I decided to change it to a two-people game because it would
be more practical.
-Key is a better tool to store player info than player names.
-Added tie as a boolean so that the result field can contain 
three values: 'playerOne', 'playerTwo' and 'tie'.
-I decided to give players 3 points for a win, 1 point for a tie 
and 0 points for a loss. The rule is based on soccer's rule.
-Added gameOver to show the state of the game
